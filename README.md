Documentation and notes for legacy support for Autographer wearable personal camera by OMG Life.

Autographer is a hands-free, wearable digital camera developed by OMG Life. The camera uses five different sensors to determine when to automatically take photos and can take up to 2,000 pictures a day. It was released in July 2013 and is used primarily for lifelogging, entertainment and travel. As of 16 October 2016, OMG Life, the company behind Autographer discontinued operations.

Autographer can take up to 2,000 photos a day and contains 8GB of memory that can store up to 16,000 images. The Autographer has a 5-megapixel camera with a 136-degree field of view which gives every picture a slight fish-eye effect.

In addition to a PIR motion detector, the Autographer unit also has:
* Colour sensor: Autographer’s ‘eye’, perceiving light and brightness and adjusting the image accordingly
* Temperature: in built thermometer, measuring ambient temperature
* Magnetometer: determines which direction the camera is facing
* Accelerometer: measures how quickly or slowly the Autographer is accelerating

It then combines all this information with its algorithm to decide when to take a picture.
